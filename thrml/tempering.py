Parallel tempering utilities built on THRML's block Gibbs samplers.

This module orchestrates multiple tempered chains (one per beta/model), runs
blocked Gibbs steps on each, and proposes swaps between adjacent temperatures.
It does not alter core sampling code; it simply composes existing
`BlockSamplingProgram`s.
