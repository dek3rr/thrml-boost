"""
Graph-coloring utilities for automatic construction of sampling order.

The key entry point is :func:`auto_color_blocks`, which inspects a set of
:class:`~hamon.InteractionGroup` objects and returns a ``free_super_blocks``
list ready to pass directly into :class:`~hamon.BlockGibbsSpec`.

Background
----------
Block Gibbs sampling only requires that blocks within the *same* sampling group
are conditionally independent — i.e. no block in the group appears as a tail
(neighbour) of any other block in the group.  Deciding which blocks can share a
group is equivalent to graph colouring: nodes are blocks, and there is an edge
between two blocks whenever one block's nodes appear in an interaction that
affects the other block.  Each colour class becomes one ``SuperBlock``
(sampling group), and blocks in the same colour class are updated
simultaneously from the same global-state snapshot.

Fewer colour groups → fewer sequential write-back barriers per scan step →
faster wall-clock time.  The greedy algorithm used here gives the *chromatic
number* for bipartite graphs (the most common case in practice) and produces a
good colouring for general graphs, though it is not globally optimal for all
graph topologies.

    """Derive a minimal parallel sampling order from the interaction graph.

    Analyses which free blocks interact with which others and returns a list of
    ``SuperBlock`` values (each either a plain :class:`~hamon.Block` or a
    tuple of :class:`~hamon.Block` objects) that can be passed directly to
    :class:`~hamon.BlockGibbsSpec` as ``free_super_blocks``.

    Blocks assigned to the same ``SuperBlock`` are conditionally independent —
    their nodes never appear in each other's ``tail_nodes`` — so they can safely
    be updated simultaneously from the same global-state snapshot.

    The algorithm runs at program-construction time (Python, no JAX tracing) and
    is O(|blocks|² + |interaction_groups| · |block_sizes|) — negligible compared
    with the sampling loop.

    **Arguments:**

    - ``free_blocks``: The free blocks whose sampling order you want to optimise.
      The order of this list is preserved within each colour group, so the
      resulting ``BlockGibbsSpec`` will have the same ``free_blocks`` ordering.
    - ``interaction_groups``: The compiled interactions for your program (e.g.
      the output of ``factor.to_interaction_groups()``).  Only interactions whose
      *head* nodes belong to ``free_blocks`` contribute to the conflict graph.

    **Returns:**

    A list of ``SuperBlock`` values.  Pass this directly to
    ``BlockGibbsSpec(free_super_blocks=..., ...)``.

    **Example** — Ising checkerboard::

        nodes  = [SpinNode() for _ in range(5)]
        edges  = [(nodes[i], nodes[i + 1]) for i in range(4)]
        model  = IsingEBM(nodes, edges, ...)

        even   = Block(nodes[::2])   # {0, 2, 4}
        odd    = Block(nodes[1::2])  # {1, 3}

        # Without auto_color_blocks the user must know that even/odd are
        # independent and manually write:
        #   free_super_blocks = [(even, odd)]
        #
        # With auto_color_blocks:
        igs    = [f.to_interaction_groups() for f in model.factors]
        igs    = [g for sublist in igs for g in sublist]
        super_blocks = auto_color_blocks([even, odd], igs)
