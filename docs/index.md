# Hamon

**JAX-native thermal sampling for discrete energy-based models.**

---

Hamon gives you GPU-accelerated block Gibbs sampling and non-reversible parallel
tempering for Ising models, Boltzmann machines, and other discrete energy-based
models — all in pure JAX.

```python
import jax
from hamon import SpinNode, Block, SamplingSchedule, sample_states
from hamon.models import IsingEBM, IsingSamplingProgram, hinton_init
import jax.numpy as jnp

# Define a 5-spin Ising chain
nodes = [SpinNode() for _ in range(5)]
edges = [(nodes[i], nodes[i + 1]) for i in range(4)]
model = IsingEBM(nodes, edges, jnp.zeros(5), jnp.ones(4) * 0.5, jnp.array(1.0))

# Two-color block Gibbs
free_blocks = [Block(nodes[::2]), Block(nodes[1::2])]
program = IsingSamplingProgram(model, free_blocks, [])

key = jax.random.key(0)
k1, k2 = jax.random.split(key)
state = hinton_init(k1, model, free_blocks, ())
schedule = SamplingSchedule(n_warmup=100, n_samples=1000, steps_per_sample=2)

samples = sample_states(k2, program, schedule, state, [], [Block(nodes)])
```

## Why "Hamon"?

In Japanese swordsmithing, the *hamon* (刃文) is the visible wave along a katana's
edge — a pattern created entirely by differential hardening. The smith coats the
blade in clay, heats it to critical temperature, and quenches it. The edge cools
fast into hard martensite; the spine cools slowly into tough pearlite. The hamon
is the boundary between phases, born from a thermal process.

This library does the same thing computationally. It runs MCMC chains at different
temperatures and exchanges information across the thermal gradient. Structure
emerges at the boundary between mixing regimes — hot chains explore, cold chains
resolve detail, and communication between them is what makes sampling work.

## What Hamon provides

**Block Gibbs sampling** on sparse, heterogeneous factor graphs with JAX-native
compilation. Define your model as nodes, factors, and blocks; Hamon handles the
index bookkeeping and padding for you.

**Non-reversible parallel tempering (NRPT)** with single-pass DEO swaps,
adaptive schedule optimization, and round-trip diagnostics. Based on the
theoretical framework of
[Syed et al. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02939).

**Automatic chain count discovery** via `discover_chain_count`, which estimates
the communication barrier Λ and recommends how many tempering chains you need.

**Dynamic block management** with influence-aware partitioning, per-temperature
block sizing, and correlation-based re-blocking.

## Origin

Hamon began as a performance fork of
[Extropic AI's THRML](https://github.com/Extropic-AI/thrml) library. It has
since diverged into an independent project with its own algorithmic contributions.
